## Market Drivers
Rising Pet Ownership and Humanization Trends

Over the past decade, pet ownership has risen significantly across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, with small breed dogs being particularly popular among urban dwellers and apartment residents. The humanization of pets has accelerated spending on nutrition, wellness, and specialty products, prompting manufacturers to develop tailored small breed dog food with optimal nutrient profiles.

Pet owners are increasingly informed about the importance of nutrition in preventing health issues such as obesity, dental problems, and digestive sensitivities. As a result, manufacturers are incorporating high-quality proteins, prebiotics, probiotics, and joint-supporting nutrients into formulations designed specifically for small breeds. These health-centric innovations significantly enhance the market appeal of small breed dog food.

Premiumization of Pet Food Products

Premium and super-premium segments are expanding as consumers seek natural, grain-free, and organic ingredients for their pets.
